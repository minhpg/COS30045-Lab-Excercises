		<h1>Pets and the Pandemic</h1>
		<h2>Swinburne University of Technology</h2>
		<p>
		  A report from Animal Medicines Australia (AMA) has found that many
		  Australians took the opportunity to introduce a pet into their household
		  during the pandemic. Their survey indicated that there was a significant
		  increase in the percent of households taking in a new dog, fish or bird.
		  Their research also indicated that pets had a number of positive
		  influences on their lives such as:
		</p>
		<ul>
		  <li>companionship</li>
		  <li>better mental health</li>
		  <li>joy and happiness.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
		  With the increase in pet ownership the AMA are encouraging policy makers
		  to consider the needs of companion animals and their owners when
		  considering rental, strata and body corporate regulations are well as
		  accepting animals in public places and transport.
